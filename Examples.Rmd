```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## Package version
This package is built with 'r GetVersion()'

## Interpolation

The package comes with example discount curves:

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
library(ralibr)

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = EUR_6M_20160930,mapping = aes(X,X.1)) + geom_point()

ggplot(data = EUR_OIS_20160930,mapping = aes(X,X.1)) + geom_point()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
